ComputeDisparity:
  For each Y in ImageL:
    For each X in ImageL:
      Compute the template size
      Compute the number of candidate pixels
      Losses = []
      For each candidate pixel: 
        Compute Disparity Metric over candidate pixel neighborhood and root neighborhood
        Append Disparity Matric to Losses

      BestIndex = argmin(Losses)

      Disparity[X,Y] = BestIndex
